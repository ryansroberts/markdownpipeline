### Evidence Statement CG15AdultES160
Ev idence within this systematic review 176 for HDL cholesterol showed a higher analytical (6%) and biological (7.5%) variation than total cholesterol, however, two or three values were re quired to estimate true HDL cholesterol levels to within 10 to 15%. Variations were also found between non-fasting and fasting blood samples as HDL cholesterol is 5%10% lower in the non-fasting state, suggesting that non-fasting measurement may slightly overestimate coronary heart disease risk, but not enough to make accuracy of screening unacceptable
